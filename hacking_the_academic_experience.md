Hacking the Academic Experience
Emily Stolfo

- Academia and hacking shouldn't be mutually exclusive
- Key to getting people more interested in coding is hybrid coding/teachers
  - Need programmers coming in as educators (or vice-versa)

- Foundations of Computer Science are essential
- A generation in tech is arguably shorter than one in other subjects
